You can see every steps of our journey in the timeline at the bottom of our window. You can control them by either dragging the pointer left and right or by using the arrows on the left. The Play Button in the middle shows the construction of our design step by step. Try it out if you want. The buttons beside the Play Button push the pointer one step left or right. The buttons far left and right push the pointer to the beginning and the end of our design.",
